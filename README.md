# CPM

Management tool which allows creation, storage, and easy access to red vs. blue competition passwords using a discord bot. Written with discord.py.
Mainly a starter project for me to learn discord.py, we may use it some day but I doubt it.

Usage:
go make a bot https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html
then download these files, edit "secrets.txt" to contain your bot token
then run main.py
