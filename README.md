Management tool which allows creation, storage, and easy access to red vs. blue competition passwords using a discord bot. Written with discord.py.
Mainly a starter project for me to learn discord.py, we may use it some day but I doubt it.

Usage:
1. go make a bot https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html
2. then download these files, edit "secrets.txt" to contain your bot token
3. pip install discord.py
4. invite your bot to your server using the OAuth2 section of the application page, give bot permission (need manage perms on discord server)
5. then run main.py

I am not a support person. If this doesn't work don't expect my assistance. There are thousands of toutorials on how to join bots to servers.
